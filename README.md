# YoucodeRestaurant
This repo is used to collaborate with my teammates while creating an app for our school that allows students and staff to pre-book lunch and lets the restarant staff us know how many dishes they have to prepeare and so the chef will know what we like and don't like and let us not waste food. To view the application, please click here <a href="https://omarkazoum.github.io/YoucodeRestaurant/index.html">ici</a>.
