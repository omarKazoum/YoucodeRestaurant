# YoucodeRestaurant
This repo is used to collaborate with my teammates while creating an app for our school that allows students and staff to pre-book a meal and lets us know how many dishes we have to cook and so the cook will know what we like and don't like and let us not waste food. To view the application, please click here <a href="https://omarkazoum.github.io/YoucodeRestaurant/index.html">ici</a>.
